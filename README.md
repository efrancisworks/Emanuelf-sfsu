# Hi there, I'm Emanuel! ðŸ‘‹ 

I'm currently a Computer Science major, looking to learn new skills and collaborate on cool projects. On my GitHub you'll find projects that I've used for:
- Language proficiency,
- University course work 
- Experiments with new technologies and frameworks
- Tools that I use daily, etc.

I hope that you are able to find something interesting here that you can use or contribute to.


- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a retro game called Pong. With the help of Harvard University's CS50 class, I'm exploring a new world of game creation. You can check out my progress at the [animated-invention](https://github.com/Emanuelf-sfsu/animated-invention) repository.
